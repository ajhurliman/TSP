<h1>Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem</h1>

This is an algorithm I wrote after reading an article about a similar
algorithm: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/792887/Travelling-Salesman-Genetic-Algorithm

I haven't read the source code described in the article, I mostly made
this as an exercise to hone my JavaScript. In the article he gets more
intricate with the mutations, whereas mine only has a simple "swap"
feature. Also, I didn't finish reading the article so there are probably
more features that I just didn't read about.
